# Transactions

Blueprints by default uses transaction, meaning that before every test transaction is started and after every test that 
transaction is dropped which resets database.

Sometimes using transactions is not possible (eg. using MongoDB or in cucumber scenarios). In that case you can turn off
transactions when enabling Blueprints. Be aware though that disabling transactions on relational databases is quite a 
major performance loss.

# ORM support

Blueprints is not tied to any ORM, however it does use [database_cleaner gem](https://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner)
whenever it can detect any ORM.
